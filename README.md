# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple word-guessing game where you need to guess the hidden word one letter at a time. Can you figure out the word before running out of lives?

## Rules

1. The game will choose a random word, and you have to guess it one letter at a time.

2. You start with a certain number of lives (typically 6). For each incorrect guess, you lose a life.

3. You can only guess one letter at a time. Make sure to enter a valid single letter (A to Z).

4. If the letter you guessed is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, you'll lose a life.

5. The game continues until you guess the entire word or run out of lives.

6. You can see the number of remaining lives and the letters you've already guessed.

7. Once you win or lose, the game will inform you of the result and allow you to start a new game.
